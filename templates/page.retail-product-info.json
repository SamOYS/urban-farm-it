This is especially true when you have Urban Farm-It and our associated resources to guide you on your journey.<\/p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Below we have tutorial videos that explain step-by-step how to approach the main growing methods used for the species above. Itâ€™s important to remember that mushroom growing is diverse, meaning that one method can be applicable to multiple species types.<\/p>\n<h3 data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Ways to grow mushrooms<\/h3>\n<ul data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Beds &amp; Pathways<\/strong> - Layering of growth material (substrate) such as wood chips or straw with your mushroom grain spawn. It can be done in raised planters, old beds or even just straight on the ground! This method allows you to convert previously un-productive space (such as paths or dark areas) into living and growing food production space.<\/li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Mulch<\/strong> - Simply mix mushroom grain spawn in with fresh straw or wood chips and let nature take its course. Incorporating mushroom spawn into your mulch effectively doubles your growing space as it takes up no more space to produce an extra type crop. As well as this, nutrients will become available for your plants more quickly and the problem of pests reduced.<\/li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Containers<\/strong> - Mixing of your chosen growth substrate with mushroom spawn in containers such as buckets or bags. This method allows you to grow mushrooms indoors, where you can achieve year round production of a host of varieties!<\/li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Logs<\/strong> - Inoculating hardwood logs with mushroom plugs. This is the most natural way to grow mushrooms and is a true permaculture method. It is slower than the other methods. However, you can be producing for up to 8 years with little to no maintenance!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>","width":"100%","alignment":"center"}},"cf3c7063-f3b9-406c-880e-2a2e529362a1":{"type":"liquid","settings":{"code":"<h3>Mushroom Growing Top Tips:<\/h3>\n<p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Tip 1:<\/strong> Do not let the mycelium dry out or become waterlogged. A happy middle ground with plenty of moisture is ideal.<\/li>\n  <li><strong>Tip 2:<\/strong> The more spawn you add, the faster it will colonise and ultimately produce!<\/li>\n  <li><strong>Tip 3:<\/strong> Avoid contamination.
