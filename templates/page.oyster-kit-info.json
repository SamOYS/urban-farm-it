But if you cannot start right away, store at 10oC (no lower).<\/li><li>Remove the black substrate bag and stand it upright in a kitchen sink or similar and open it at the top.<\/li><li>In order to pasteurise the substrate, add 3 litres of boiling water, be careful to avoid scalding yourself. Carefully, fold the bag closed and peg\/tape it shut in order to retain the heat. Leave to stand for at least 8 hours or until properly cooled. This is extremely important as temperatures above 30oC could kill the spawn.<\/li><li>Once cooled, cut off each bottom corner just enough to let the water drain. Leave for 30 minutes or until no further liquid drains out.<\/li><li>Thoroughly wash your hands and forearms with soap to remove the risk of contamination. Take the bag of mushroom spawn and crumble it into small pieces. Open the black bag at the top and add the spawn to the substrate. Using your hands mix the spawn evenly throughout the whole of the substrate. An even mixture is critical for fast growth.<\/li><li>Double\/triple fold the top of the bag shut and compress the substrate bag to remove trapped air, then secure using the peg or tape. Taking a knife, cut 5-6  X shaped cuts of approximately 3cm across on each face of the bag (or just one face if you plan to grow with the bag in the horizontal position) try to ensure even spacing. In time the mushrooms will grow from these cuts.<\/li><li>Lay the black bag inside the mushroom box and liner. Fold the box liner over to help retain moisture. Close the flaps of the box and weigh them down shut. Store in a warm place, with a constant temperature of 20oC-24oC for 13-16 days (It is critical for maximum productivity that incubation is fully complete before starting the next stage). The kit will require no further care during this period. Incubation is complete once the developing thick white cotton wool-like mycelium has occupied ALL of the substrate.<\/li><li>When ready, move the box to an airy but not draughty location, with plenty of natural daylight but not in direct sunlight. Ideally 18oC-25oC. Open the flaps of the box so that the mushrooms are able to breathe. Leave the flaps pointing up and pull the edge of the liner over them. The decrease in temperature and increased aeration stimulates the mushrooms to fruit. If free from drought, you can place the black bag in a vertical position, in the centre of the box to create more natural shaped oyster mushrooms.<\/li><li>Once the box is opened it is critical that the mushrooms do not dry out. Spray into the holes with water twice a day, but not excessively (this may encourage unwanted mould growth). It is also good practice to spray the growing environment created by the white liner. This maintains air humidity, something that mushrooms love! When the young mushrooms (known as pins) begin to force their way through the bag, increase this to watering three times a day, but do not spray the mushroom directly.<\/li><li>In 10-30 days you will be enjoying your first flush! The growth rate will vary depending on environmental conditions, but they may double in size every 24hrs. When fully mature, they will curl up at the edges, trying to harvest just before this stage.<br\/><br\/>In order to harvest, twist the clump one complete turn, rather than pulling. Do not cut the mushroom as the remaining stump may encourage rot.<br\/><br\/>12)  You will find that many pins are produced, but some will abort. Harvest only healthy and fresh looking mushrooms. Do not eat aborted or old mushrooms as they are inedible.<\/li><li>After harvest, continue care as described in steps 8-12. Your next flush should occur 10-20 days later. The kit should produce 4 or even 5 flushes, but they are likely to get progressively weaker. If your flushes do not occur, see point 4 in troubleshooting.<\/li><li>Once the kit is exhausted, add it to your compost pile and you may be rewarded with an extra flush!<\/li><\/ol>"}}},"block_order":["template--19421144580376__cac27666-d8d7-456b-a62c-f0be731de0d0-16871642501450b4ec-0","template--19421144580376__cac27666-d8d7-456b-a62c-f0be731de0d0-16871642501450b4ec-1"],"custom_css":["li {padding: 2rem 0;}","li:not(li:last-of-type) {border-bottom: 1px solid #5a5a5a;}"],"settings":{"align_text":"left","narrow_column":true,"divider":false}},"8139939c-6f1b-427b-a90c-64faab59a868":{"type":"text-and-image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/IMG-20200620-WA0005-1.jpg","image_width":700,"subtitle":"Mushroom Cooking Guide","title":"How To Use Your Mushrooms","text":"<p>Prior to cooking, oyster mushrooms should be prepared by removing the tough stem ends as these are fairly chewy.
